# Community Asset Bundle - Miscellaneous

The Community Asset Bundles (CAB) are varied collections of 3D models, Unity asset bundles, and configurations for the HBS BattleTech 2018 game. They are a mod developers resource that provide no benefit on their own, and end-users have no reason to download or interact with them unless instructed to do so. Mod developers can use them to include new models into the game, if they understand how assets are loaded by the game.

## Contents

*Community Asset Bundle - Miscellaneous* contains a variety of non-canon or customized models from across different factions and timeframes in the BattleTech universe. A handful of models are canonical but do not fit other bundles, or have limitations that make them unsuited for other bundles. 

Some models within can be used with the base game. Most `chrprftrt` assetbundles are turrets that can be used as base game models. 

Other models require the mod [CustomUnits](https://github.com/BattletechModders/CustomAmmoCategories/CustomUnits/) from the [CustomAmmoCategories](https://github.com/BattletechModders/CustomAmmoCategories/) repository. You can find instructions and configuration details at [CustomUnits Documentation](https://github.com/BattletechModders/CustomAmmoCategories/tree/master/AdditionalFiles/CU). Models with _lam_, _body_, or multiple forms (_ajaxbase_ and _ajaxfighterbase_) fall under this category.

Because of this ambiguity, you should consider going to one of the discords mentioned in the **Custom License Requests** section and ask for help getting started. 

The list of available units changes over time; look in /assetbundles/ directory for a comprehensive list. 

## Usage
Models within the CABs have been donated by various modelers to the community **for use as a unified resource only**. You may not extract, copy, or distribute the models within any of the CABs without integrating with the CAB directly. This means your users must download the CAB repository directly from their own machine. 

You may not use the CAB models for 3D printing, even for individual use. 

You may not use the CAB models for any other game. If you want to use them in another Battletech themed game, make a Custom License Request below.

No support is given for the CAB. It's expected that you understand how these systems work already.

## Custom License Requests

As stated above, the models in the CAB are provided to the community as a unified resource. Some models within were released by their modeler under a more permissive license. If you'd like to redistribute models from the CAB in a more limited fashion, please go to one of the following discords and make a 'CAB Custom License Request':

* [BTA 3062](https://discord.gg/5WyhtRP42j) - use channel #modding-technical 
* [RogueTech](https://discord.gg/roguetech) - use channel #modding-and-model-making-questions 
* [Battletech Extended](https://discord.gg/wDPcwYPC4Q) - use channel #other-mods

## End User Installers

Jamie Wolf (@jamie wolf#5379) has provided several mod packs with installers that make downloading the CAB convenient for end-users. If you are interested in such an integration, please contact him on the RogueTech discord.
